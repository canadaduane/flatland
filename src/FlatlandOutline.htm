With an Application of the Theory of Relativity in Two Dimensions</h2></center>

<h2>Objective</h2>
<p>Take the two-dimensional world of Flatland as described by Edwin Abbott and
create a mathematically derived working model of it using the Java programming
language.  The user will be able to act the part of A. Square via keyboard control. 
Once the model is sufficiently developed, the Special Theory of Relativity will be
introduced as a governing law for all objects within Flatland.  By significantly
reducing the Speed of Light constant, the normally unobservable effects of relativity
(such as Lorentz Contraction and Spectrum Shifting) will become visible during normal
Flatlander activities.</p>


<h2>Basic User Interface Layout</h2>

<p>The screen will be divided into three portions:</p>


<table border=1>
  <tr align=center valign=center height=210>
    <td width=80>A</td>
    <td width=240>B</td>
  </tr>
  <tr height=30>
    <td colspan=2>C</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>Section <b>A</b> will contain an Options Panel in which the various user-defined properties can be selected (e.g. Speed of Light constant, Color on/off, Fog on/off).</p>

<p>Section <b>B</b> will contain the Flatland world as it would be seen from the 3rd dimension (“above”).  The frame of reference will center on a selected object (e.g. A. Square could be chosen as the Frame of Reference, in which case the world would appear to be passing him by).</p>

<p>Section <b>C</b> will contain a length showing 90° of one-dimensional vision (i.e. as A. Square is seeing Flatland).</p>


<h2>Geometric Objects Modeled From Flatland</h2>
 I. <b>Figures</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; Line (Women)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. &nbsp; Isosceles (Criminals)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. &nbsp; Equilateral (Tradesmen)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; D. &nbsp; Square (Doctor)<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; E. &nbsp; Pentagon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; F. &nbsp; Hexagon<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; G. &nbsp; Polygon of 7-12 Sides (Noblemen)</br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; H. &nbsp; Circle of 13+ Sides (Priests)</br>
 II. <b>Structures</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; Houses<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. &nbsp; Trees<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; i. &nbsp; Fruit<br>

<h2>Features</h2>
 I. <b>Figures</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; Eyes – a secondary window will provide First-person Perspective of the two-dimensional world as seen through the eyes of A. Square.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. &nbsp; Arms – all Figures propel themselves through the two-dimensional atmospheric medium using their limbs.  The medium will have a user-defined friction coefficient so that moving objects will eventually slow down (and, presumably, so that Figures have a medium through which they can propel themselves).<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. &nbsp; Color – if the user desires, he can turn Color on and off for each figure or for the whole world.  Color will cause shapes in the First-person Perspective to be more distinguishable.<br>
 II. <b>Fog</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; Shows a brightening effect with distance squared<br>
 III. <b>Frame of Reference</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; Any object can be defined as the world Frame of Reference.  The user can click on an individual object to make that object at rest.  It will appear that all other objects move in relation to the selected object.  In this way, the Lorentz Transformations can be seen from within any Flatlander's Frame of Reference.<br>
 IV. <b>User-defined Speed of Light Constant</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; All objects in the world will show Lorentz Contraction based on their speed with relation to the current Frame of Reference.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; B. &nbsp; If Color is turned on, the First-person Perspective view will show spectrum-shifted light of each object due to the Doppler Effect.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; C. &nbsp; If the Information option is selected, each Figure will have its age displayed next to it so that a Figure moving at near-light speed will, when decelerated, see the elapsed difference in time due to Time Dilation.<br>
 V. <b>User-defined Gravitational Constant</b><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; A. &nbsp; All objects that are not assigned to be “stationary” (e.g. houses and trees are immovable) will be affected by gravity.  The Gravitational Constant will be an inverse square law showing its greatest effect in the Southern regions.<br>
